# Portfolio <br />

## Description:
    
  My professional website showcasing projects that I have completed implementing modern web technologies. The
  site is fully responsive and built in a simple and clean style.
  
  The site includes links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profile pages.  There's also a link to download my resume in pdf
  format (if the pdf is unable to be viewed before downloading, check the browser settings), and a link to contact me
  via email.

  You'll also find a projects section where you'll find a few project screenshots displayed.  If you hover the mouse
  cursor over a screenshot you'll see two links; one to visit the live project site and one to visit the project code.

## Technologies:

  JavaScript | HTML | SASS <br />
  
  I chose to use these three technologies because this is a simple static website with a few external links.

Thank you for visiting!
